Sudoku-Solver
=============

A GUI-based sudoku solver, using both logic and guess-work.

The program does not require the terminal to use, but if you use it, you can see whenever the program makes a guess.
To input a puzzle, simply click on the appropriate square and type in the number. The puzzle will automatically fill in squares if there is only one solution, meaning that for simpler puzzles the program may solve them before you have a chance to ask it to do so. Otherwise, once you have inputted the puzzle, press the "S" key and the program will solve the puzzle using more advanced reasoning strategies, as well as guesswork when nessesary.

If the puzzle is unsolved, but self-consistent, it will appear yellow. If it unsolved AND inconsistent, it will appear red. If the puzzle is solved, it will appear green.
